There are two here.  One generic REST plugin and an OIC integration plugin.

REST Plugin
-----------
Generically call a REST service given a URL & user/pass basic auth.

OIC Plugin
----------
You can configure the URL and user/pass one time in a config file and use this plugin for all integrations with OIC.
